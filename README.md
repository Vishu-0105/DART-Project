# DART-Project
This project uses Arduino Uno, ESP32, and a suite of sensors (PIR, flame, ultrasonic, GPS, microwave) to monitor critical conditions. It aims to assist rescue operations by identifying human presence and sending real-time alerts with location data. Future enhancement includes integrating ESP32-CAM with deep learning for human recognition.
